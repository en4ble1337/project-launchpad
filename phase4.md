# Role: DevOps Engineer (Project Scaffolder)

You are initializing the project environment. The planning documents already exist:
- `docs/PRD.md` (Product Requirements)
- `docs/ARCH.md` (Technical Architecture)
- `docs/RESEARCH.md` (Implementation Research)

Your mission is to generate `setup_launchpad.py`, a Python script that creates the entire project scaffold based on these documents.

---

## Requirements

The script must:

### 1. Read Existing Documents
````python
# The script reads PRD.md, ARCH.md, and RESEARCH.md from docs/ folder
# It does NOT embed their content as string literals
# This allows the documents to be edited independently
````

### 2. Create Directory Structure

Read the "Directory Structure" section from `docs/ARCH.md` and create all specified folders.

**Always include these base folders:**
- `docs/` (already exists, but ensure it does)
- `directives/`
- `execution/`
- `src/`
- `tests/`
- `.tmp/`

**Add project-specific subfolders** as defined in ARCH.md (e.g., `src/api/`, `src/models/`, `src/services/`).

### 3. Generate Standard Files

#### `.gitignore`
````
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
.venv/
venv/
env/
*.egg-info/
dist/
build/

# Environment
.env
.env.local
*.local

# IDE
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.swo

# Project
.tmp/
*.log
````

#### `.env.example`
Generate based on ARCH.md "Security Considerations" section. Include all required environment variables as placeholders:
````
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname

# Security
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here

# External Services (if any from ARCH.md Integration Points)
# STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_xxx
````

#### `README.md`
````markdown
# [Project Name from PRD]

[One-line description from PRD Introduction]

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
3. Run `python setup_genesis.py` (if not already run)
4. Follow `directives/001_initial_setup.md`

## Documentation

- [Product Requirements](docs/PRD.md)
- [Technical Architecture](docs/ARCH.md)
- [Implementation Research](docs/RESEARCH.md)
- [Agent Instructions](AGENTS.md)

## Project Structure

[Insert directory tree from ARCH.md]
````

#### `requirements.txt` (or `pyproject.toml` for Python projects)
Extract dependencies from ARCH.md "Tech Stack" section:
````
fastapi>=0.109.0
uvicorn>=0.27.0
sqlalchemy>=2.0.0
asyncpg>=0.29.0
pydantic>=2.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
pytest>=8.0.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.23.0
httpx>=0.27.0
````

### 4. Generate `AGENTS.md` (Root)

This is the "bootloader" that agents read first. Include project-specific context extracted from PRD and ARCH.
````markdown
# AGENTS.md - System Kernel

## Project Context

**Name:** [From PRD]
**Purpose:** [One sentence from PRD Introduction]
**Stack:** [From ARCH.md Tech Stack summary]

## Core Domain Entities

[List from ARCH.md Dictionary - just the terms, not full definitions]

Example:
- Task: A unit of work with status and priority
- Workspace: Container for related tasks
- User: Authenticated system actor

---

## 1. The Prime Directive

You are an Anti-Gravity Agent operating on the [Project Name] codebase.

**Before writing ANY code:**
1. Read `docs/PRD.md` to understand WHAT we are building
2. Read `docs/ARCH.md` to understand HOW we structure it
3. Consult `docs/RESEARCH.md` for proven patterns to follow
4. Check `directives/` for your current assignment

**Core Rules:**
- Use ONLY the technologies defined in ARCH.md Tech Stack
- Use ONLY the terms defined in ARCH.md Dictionary
- Follow ONLY the API contracts defined in ARCH.md
- Place code ONLY in the directories specified in ARCH.md

---

## 2. The 3-Layer Workflow

### Layer 1: Directives (Orders)
- Location: `directives/`
- Purpose: Task assignments with specific acceptance criteria
- Action: Read the lowest-numbered incomplete directive

### Layer 2: Orchestration (Planning)
- Location: `.tmp/`
- Purpose: Your scratchpad for planning and notes
- Action: Break complex tasks into steps before coding

### Layer 3: Execution (Automation)
- Location: `execution/`
- Purpose: Reusable scripts for repetitive tasks
- Examples: `run_migrations.py`, `seed_data.py`, `run_tests.py`

---

## 3. The Testing Mandate

**No implementation without a failing test.**

Workflow:
1. Write test in `tests/` that describes expected behavior
2. Run test, confirm it fails
3. Write minimum code in `src/` to make test pass
4. Refactor if needed
5. Confirm all tests still pass

Test file locations mirror source:
- `src/api/tasks.py` → `tests/api/test_tasks.py`
- `src/services/task_service.py` → `tests/services/test_task_service.py`

---

## 4. Definition of Done

A task is complete when:
- [ ] Code exists in appropriate `src/` subdirectory
- [ ] All new code has corresponding tests in `tests/`
- [ ] All tests pass (`pytest`)
- [ ] Type checking passes (if using typed Python/TypeScript)
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Related PRD User Story acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Directive file is marked as Complete

---

## 5. File Naming Conventions

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Python modules | snake_case | `task_service.py` |
| Python classes | PascalCase | `class TaskService` |
| Test files | `test_` prefix | `test_task_service.py` |
| Directives | `NNN_description.md` | `001_initial_setup.md` |
| API routes | Plural nouns | `/api/tasks`, `/api/users` |

---

## 6. Commit Message Format
````
type(scope): description

[optional body]

Refs: directive-NNN
````

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`

Example:
````
feat(api): add POST /tasks endpoint

Implements task creation with validation.
Refs: directive-002
````
````

### 5. Generate First Directive

Create `directives/001_initial_setup.md`:
````markdown
# Directive 001: Initial Environment Setup

## Objective

Configure the development environment and verify all dependencies are working.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ installed
- PostgreSQL running (or configured DATABASE_URL)
- Git initialized

## Steps

### Step 1: Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or: .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your local values
```

### Step 4: Verify Database Connection
```bash
python execution/verify_setup.py
```

### Step 5: Run Initial Tests
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Virtual environment created and activated
- [ ] All dependencies installed without errors
- [ ] `.env` file exists with valid configuration
- [ ] `verify_setup.py` passes all checks
- [ ] `pytest` runs (even if no tests exist yet)

## Status: [ ] Incomplete / [ ] Complete

## Notes

[Agent: Add any issues encountered or decisions made]
````

### 6. Generate Verification Script

Create `execution/verify_setup.py`:
````python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Verify that the development environment is correctly configured.
Run this after initial setup to confirm everything works.
"""

import sys
from pathlib import Path

def check_python_version():
    """Verify Python version meets requirements."""
    required = (3, 11)
    current = sys.version_info[:2]
    if current < required:
        return False, f"Python {required[0]}.{required[1]}+ required, found {current[0]}.{current[1]}"
    return True, f"Python {current[0]}.{current[1]} ✓"

def check_env_file():
    """Verify .env file exists."""
    env_path = Path(".env")
    if not env_path.exists():
        return False, ".env file not found (copy from .env.example)"
    return True, ".env file exists ✓"

def check_required_dirs():
    """Verify project structure exists."""
    required = ["src", "tests", "docs", "directives", "execution"]
    missing = [d for d in required if not Path(d).is_dir()]
    if missing:
        return False, f"Missing directories: {', '.join(missing)}"
    return True, "All directories exist ✓"

def check_docs():
    """Verify planning documents exist."""
    docs = ["docs/PRD.md", "docs/ARCH.md", "docs/RESEARCH.md"]
    missing = [d for d in docs if not Path(d).exists()]
    if missing:
        return False, f"Missing documents: {', '.join(missing)}"
    return True, "PRD.md, ARCH.md, and RESEARCH.md exist ✓"

def main():
    checks = [
        ("Python Version", check_python_version),
        ("Environment File", check_env_file),
        ("Directory Structure", check_required_dirs),
        ("Documentation", check_docs),
    ]
    
    print("=" * 50)
    print("Environment Verification")
    print("=" * 50)
    
    all_passed = True
    for name, check_func in checks:
        passed, message = check_func()
        status = "✓" if passed else "✗"
        print(f"[{status}] {name}: {message}")
        if not passed:
            all_passed = False
    
    print("=" * 50)
    if all_passed:
        print("All checks passed! Environment is ready.")
        return 0
    else:
        print("Some checks failed. Please fix the issues above.")
        return 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())
````

### 7. Generate IDE Configuration

Create `.cursorrules` (or `.windsurfrules`):
````
# Cursor AI Rules for [Project Name]

## Session Start Protocol
ALWAYS read these files at the start of EVERY session:
1. AGENTS.md (this project's conventions and workflow)
2. docs/ARCH.md (technical architecture and constraints)
3. docs/RESEARCH.md (proven patterns and anti-patterns)
4. directives/ (find your current task)

## Code Generation Rules
- Use ONLY technologies listed in docs/ARCH.md Tech Stack
- Follow directory structure defined in docs/ARCH.md
- Use domain terms EXACTLY as defined in ARCH.md Dictionary
- Write tests BEFORE implementation

## Forbidden Actions
- Do NOT install packages not listed in requirements.txt without approval
- Do NOT create files outside the defined directory structure
- Do NOT deviate from API contracts in ARCH.md
- Do NOT use .tmp/ for anything except temporary planning notes
````

---

## Script Structure

The final `setup_genesis.py` should:
````python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Launchpad Setup Script
Creates project scaffold based on PRD.md, ARCH.md, and RESEARCH.md
"""

import os
from pathlib import Path

# Configuration extracted/summarized from docs
PROJECT_NAME = "..."  # From PRD
DIRECTORIES = [...]    # Base + from ARCH.md
# ... etc

def create_directories():
    ...

def create_gitignore():
    ...

def create_env_example():
    ...

def create_readme():
    ...

def create_requirements():
    ...

def create_agents_md():
    ...

def create_initial_directive():
    ...

def create_verify_script():
    ...

def create_ide_config():
    ...

def main():
    print(f"Initializing {PROJECT_NAME}...")
    create_directories()
    create_gitignore()
    create_env_example()
    create_readme()
    create_requirements()
    create_agents_md()
    create_initial_directive()
    create_verify_script()
    create_ide_config()
    print("Genesis complete! Run: python execution/verify_setup.py")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
````

---

## Output

Provide ONLY the complete Python code block for `setup_genesis.py`, customized to the specific PRD and ARCH content.

---

## Validation Checklist

Before providing the script:

- [ ] Script reads from existing docs/, does not embed content
- [ ] All directories from ARCH.md are created
- [ ] `.gitignore` covers the tech stack (Python, Node, etc.)
- [ ] `.env.example` includes all secrets from ARCH.md Security section
- [ ] `README.md` references correct project name and structure
- [ ] `requirements.txt` matches ARCH.md Tech Stack versions
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` includes project-specific context (name, entities, stack)
- [ ] First directive has concrete, verifiable steps
- [ ] Verification script tests actual requirements
- [ ] IDE config enforces AGENTS.md reading
